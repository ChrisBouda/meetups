## Details

As any other new technology, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning hold the potential to be used both for good and less noble purposes. Following up on our May meetup, we will discuss both sides, and how we can influence the outcome.

The first talk will be given by KiwiSecurity, a Vienna-based company employing computer vision to automate video surveillance.

**Talk 1:
Deep Learning for Object Detection in Video Surveillance Applications**
Michelangelo Fiore, Computer Vision Developer & Florian Matusek, CCO, KiwiSecurity

In this talk, the speakers will give an overview of how KiwiSecurity is using Deep Learning for the task of people detection in video surveillance. In particular, the talk will focus on how real world constraints, such as more-than-real-time requirements, have impacted their choice in selecting Deep Learning frameworks and models, and how they have used the strategy of model pruning to improve the inference time of the video surveillance application.

**Talk 2:
AI Strategy for Austria**

As our second speaker, we will have Austrian parliamentarian Stephanie Cox. She will give insights on how policymakers decide (or don't decide) about how to use or regulate artificial intelligence and report on an interpellation
("Parlamentarische Anfrage") she filed (c.f. https://orf.at/stories/3062562/) as well as on a [strategy paper](http://www.stephaniecox.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Forderungen_Strategie_KI_Oesterreich_Stephanie_Cox_ListePilz-1.pdf) she published.

**Panel & Plenary Q&A:
AI in the government and how we can have an influence**

After the two presentations, we will have a panel discussion around how AI is positioned in the government. Is AI already used in the government? Why should the government act on legislation about AI? What other future implications arise?

We will open the floor to our community for an interactive Q&A with our panelists, including *parliamentarian Stephanie Cox, Florian Matusek, CCO, KiwiSecurity, Clemens Wasner, CEO and founder of enlite.ai and creator of AIAustria.com, and Prof. Allan Hanbury, Professor for Data Intelligence, TU Wien and Co-founder of Data Market Austria*.
This is your chance to get your suggestions into parliament! What do *you* envision for the future of AI in Austria?

We kindly thank FH Technikum Wien, in particular Thomas Faast (Innovationsmanagement), to host this evening and provide the venue and drinks & snacks.

We will also have Anexia again, who supported our last meetup and provide really nice Vienna Deep Learning Meetup T-Shirts to our community. Please come early, there are only 50 pieces left!

(Disclaimer: We do not support or endorse any political party and receive neither monetary nor other benefits. Our aim with this evening is to provide insights in the political debate regarding the very important topic of Artificial Intelligence, its usage and ethics.)
