## Details

We followed your topic request from the poll we did at the January meetup, and have chosen NLP (Natural Language Processing) as the topic for the upcoming meetup on 27th of March, with 2 splendid speakers on the topic:

**Talk 1:
An introduction to state of the art in NLP using Deep Learning**
by Liad Magen, EnliteAI
[[Slides](./slides/NLP_State_of_the_art.pdf)]

As 2012 was the year for computer vision, 2018 was the year of NLP. Pre-trained language models, transfer learning and unsupervised machine translation using GANs, to name a few. In this talk, we will review some of the latest innovations and understand their significance for machine translation, text classification and question answering.

**Talk 2:
Teaching machines to understand natural language conversations: a bag of tricks**
by Jason Hoelscher-Obermaier, AI Expert & Software Developer, Ondewo
[[Slides](./slides/NLP_teaching_machines.pdf)]

Natural language processing allows humans to talk to computer systems and thereby generates enormous economic value. ONDEWO builds a conversational AI backend which endows computer systems with natural language understanding. Jason will discuss:
- what conversational AI systems consist of
- what they can and cannot do currently
- what the main challenges are in building conversational AI systems
- and how to overcome these challenges.
