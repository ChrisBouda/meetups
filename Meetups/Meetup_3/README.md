Its going to be exciting again, with a veeery interesting talk about some of the most popular Software frameworks for Deep Learning:

**Jan Schlüter: “Open-source Deep Learning with Theano and Lasagne"**

Jan will give a brief introduction of ConvNets and two related open-source libraries for deep learning, Theano and Lasagne. He is currently pursuing his PhD at the Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), working on automated music understanding, and one of the lead developers of Lasagne.

*** CANCELLED / POSTPONED: ***

**Gregor Mitscha-Baude: "Introduction to TensorFlow"**

Gregor is doing a PhD in math/scientific computing and he will introduce Google's deep learning framework TensorFlow and his experiences with it.

-> we will have this in the 4th meetup in fall

After the talk(s), we will use the chance to discuss Lasagne, Theano, TensorFlow and/or other frameworks in comparison, highlighting pros and cons and answering questions.

Bring a laptop if possible! (ideally with Lasagne pre-installed: https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/wiki/From-Zero-to-Lasagne )
