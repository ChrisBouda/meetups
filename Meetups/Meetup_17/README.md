## Details

The 17th Vienna Deep Learning Meetup is coming up and we are presenting two exciting real-world applications of Deep Learning in image understanding:

Talk 1:

Birds.ai: AI to provide a bird’s-eye view
Anouk Visser, CTO - Birds.ai

Anouk is the CTO and Co-Founder of Birds.ai. She has over seven years of experience in AI, already applying it in three startups before she got her Master’s degree from the University of Amsterdam. In early 2016 she founded Birds.ai where she is working with her team to provide customers with a bird’s-eye view of their valuable assets to prevent unexpected failures.

In this talk, she will discuss how Birds.ai is using deep learning to find defects on Wien Energie’s wind turbine blades and solar panels. There are many challenges in finding defects in wind turbine blades, which led them to explore three different computer vision tasks (classification, detection and segmentation). She will go through bird.ai's dataset to take a look at the defects that need to be found and the experiments they have been working on so far. Finally, she will give us insight into their work on inspecting solar panels.

Talk 2:

ImageBiopsyLab: Enhancing the medical expert - how to help doctors with AI
Christoph Goetz, CTO - ImageBiopsyLab.com

Imagebiopsylab is a Vienna based startup that automates the diagnosis of X-Ray radiographs of musclular-sceletal diseases. The fun part of creating potentially live saving AI-solution is followed by an arduous process of scientific validation, publication and certification in the medical field. Nonetheless, there is more incentive now than ever to help your fellow humans by training AI and bring it to the clinic."

Hot Topics:

As usual in our meetups, the organizers will present latest news and hot topics in Deep Learning.

Wien Energie Tour:

Thanks to the collaboration of birds.ai and Wien Energie, this Meetup is hosted at the Wien Energie "Erlebniswelt" at Spittelau. Wien Energie not only provides the presentation room and drinks and snacks, but also offers tours through the Wien Energie Experience World on the day of our meetup:

What to expect?
Experience energy at a wide variety of different exhibits: ‘What is Watt?’, ‘Electricity Workshop’, ‘Heat Laboratory’ and ‘Efficiency Centre’. 19 interactive exhibits await you: generate electricity by dancing, cycle the ‘Tour de Watt’, fire real photons, and much more. You’ve come to the right place if you have a question about electricity, natural gas or district heating.
