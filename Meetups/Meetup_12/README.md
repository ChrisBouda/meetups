## Details

Dear Deep Learners,

We are happy to confirm 2 great speakers and 2 great topics for the 12th Vienna Deep Learning Meetup on June 20th at FH Technikum Wien:

• Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and Applications in Image Object Recognition

This talk is given by Philipp Kranen, a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft AI&Research working in the CNTK team focusing on deep learning algorithms and applications for computer vision including image classification and object detection.

This talk introduces the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). It is Microsoft's open-source deep learning toolkit used to train and evaluate deep neural networks which is used in Microsoft products such as the Cortana, Skype and Cognitive Services. The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit trains and evaluates deep learning algorithms faster than other available toolkits, scaling efficiently in a range of environments—from a CPU, to GPUs, to multiple machines—while maintaining accuracy. The talk will showcase some example use cases of deep learning with CNTK and focus on computer vision related tasks such as image classification and object detection.

• Generative Adversarial Networks

Our second speaker Michal Šustr is an alumni from Czech Technical University in Prague, in the field of Artificial Intelligence. He is mostly interested in machine learning and currently works at machine learning startup Blindspot Solutions.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are a method for generating the most accurate content using neural networks. It has quickly gained popularity thanks to interesting applications and progress in generative models, and was also one of the main themes at the last NIPS conference. In this lecture we will look at the research in this area.

We will be welcomed by Prof. Alexander Hoffmann from FH Technikum (Head of MSc program Game Engineering & Simulation).

As usual, the talks will be complemented by a Latest News & Hot Topics section presented by the organizers. If you have contributions for new topics, please reach out or post below the meetup agenda.

After the talks we will have plenty of time to discuss these and other Deep Learning topics and to network.

Our host the FH Technikum Wien will kindly provide drinks & snacks.

Looking forward to another great meetup!

Tom, Jan and Alex
