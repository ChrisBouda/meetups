## Details

Hi Deep Learners,

As a good start into the new year, we are going to do a Practitioner's session with hands-on Coding of Deep Learning in Python with the Keras library. We will start with the latest hot topics and a report from the NIPS conference in Dec. in Barcelona, where Yann LeCun from Facebook and Drew Purves from Google DeepMind, among many other great researchers, presented their latest results on Deep Learning, and Apple announced more collaborations with researchers.

This is our agenda for the January meetup:

• Welcome

• Brief Report from NIPS 2016 conference (Jan Schlüter)

• Hot Topics and Latest News (Tom Lidy & Jan Schlüter)

• Introduction to Coding Deep Learning algorithms with the Keras Python library (Tom Lidy, Alex Schindler): Full Networks, CNNs, RNNs (on images, music/speech, hardisk data)

• Questions & Answers, Discussion

This meetup is hosted at TU Wien.

As this is an interactive coding session, we recommend to bring your laptop. Please install the following Python libraries as guided here: https://github.com/tuwien-musicir/DL_Tutorial#installation-of-pre-requisites

As usual, there will be time, also for questions & answers and discussions.

Looking forward to this first meetup in 2017!

all the best
