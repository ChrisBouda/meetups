## Details

After our exceptional AI Summit Vienna in September, we planned to continue with our regular monthly Vienna Deep Learning Meetup series. But not quite...

We are proud to have:

Yufeng Guo
Developer Advocate for Machine Learning at Google Cloud, New York

come to Vienna to talk about the Google Deep Learning Tool - TensorFlow - and how it is used at Google and can be used for your own needs.

"TensorFlow Wide & Deep: Data Classification the easy way"

Learn how to use TensorFlow to easily combine linear regression with deep learning to create a machine learning model that has the benefits of both. You will also gain intuition about what is happening under the hood, and learn how you can use this model for your own datasets. We will also take a look at some of the ways deep learning is being applied at Google, as well as talk about how to scale your deep learning systems as your data and compute needs grow.

Our Agenda for the October meetup:

18:00 Arrival (please arrive early)
18:30 Welcome by Meetup Organizers
18:45 Introduction by Erste Group, the host of this meetup
19:00 TensorFlow Wide & Deep: Data Classification the easy way (Yufeng Guo, Google Cloud, NY)
20:00 break
20:30 One Model To Learn Them All (Valentyn Boreiko)
21:00 Latest News & Hot Topics in Deep Learning
21:30 - 23:00 Networking and Discussions

Our second speaker is Valentyn Boreiko, who will give a lightning talk about how Google approached multi-modal learning with its "One Model To Learn Them All". He will talk about the general architecture of the model as well as the essential parts such as the sparsely gated mixture-of-experts layer introduced earlier this year.

We are also very thankful to have a very special venue on this evening: the Marx Palast (also known as the Willkommen Ã–sterreich Studio). This is thanks to our sponsor of this meetup - the Erste Group - who provides both the venue and catering.

We are very much looking forward to another exciting Deep Learning Meetup with two very interesting speakers and topics!
