## Details

Dear Deep Learning community,

Our 27th Deep Learning Meetup will take place at Bosch Wien. Consequently, we will have a focus on industrial applications this time. We are going to have 2 talks that focus on Deep Learning in industry:

**Talk 1:
Deep Learning for Predictive Quality & Predictive Maintenance**
by Daniel Ressi, Data Scientist - craftworks
[[Slides](./slides/27th-deep-learning-meetup-craftworks.pdf)]

Artificial Intelligence plays a major role in Industry 4.0 and more industrial companies than ever are starting to utilize their data to gain value and insights. The industrial domain offers very promising opportunities but this potential also comes with very specific requirements and challenges.
This talk gives insights into the characteristics of Industrial AI and how state of the art deep learning methods can be applied to solve complex problems and bring more value to companies. Based on real use cases, three common areas of Industrial AI and the applied modelling approaches will be presented:

1. Predictive Maintenance: Can faults of machines be predicted in advance?
2. Visual Inspection: Can computer vision automatically assess the quality of products?
3. Predictive Quality: Can product defects be predicted in advance and prevented in future?

**Talk 2:
Advances in Automotive In-Cabin Monitoring: Present & Future**
by Florian Seitner, CEO and Michael HÃ¶dlmoser, CTO - emotion 3D
[[Slides](./slides/DL_Meetup_Presentation_emotion3D.pdf)]

This talk will outline recent topics and challenges of in-cabin driver and passenger monitoring. After a quick introduction on driver monitoring in current and future automotive environments, we will provide an overview on vision-based monitoring functionalities that exploit recent advances in ML/DL. We will discuss challenges in developing automotive in-cabin monitoring systems and possible approaches on how to tackle them.

Inbetween and after the talks there will be room for networking and discussions.

Note: Photographs and/or filming will be taken during the event for documentation purposes. The images will be published for the purpose of reporting on the event on all communication channels of the event organizers (e.g. print, online and social media). If you do not wish this, please inform the photographer on site.

We would like to thank Bosch for hosting this meetup and providing us kindly with drinks and snacks. Note that this meetup starts at 18:00.
