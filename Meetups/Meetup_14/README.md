## Details

The date for the 14th Deep Learning Meetup in Vienna is set, and we are having an international speaker again:

Lukáš Vrabel has industry experience with various machine learning tasks ranging from NLP through web page analysis to image recognition. Formerly the head of research department at Seznam.cz (http://seznam.cz/) (a major player on the search engine market in the Czech Republic), he is currently solving the world's largest industry problems using AI and machine learning at CEAI ( http://ceai.io ).

Talk Title: Evolution of Image Search @ Seznam.cz

The talk will be focused on the evolution of the image search service at Czech search engine Seznam.cz (http://www.seznam.cz). It will describe the obstacles they faced and the solutions Seznam.cz implemented. He'll briefly discuss the models, machine learning techniques and features that are used in their image search pipeline. The focus will mostly be on their investigation into deep learning in order to further improve the relevancy of the system.

Talk Outline:
- short intro about Seznam.cz and image search
- architecture of basic image search (web crawling, feature engineering, ranking models) and its problems
- integration of user feedback (solves some problems)
- integration of deep convolutional network (solves even more problems)
- future (caption generation, OCR, object detection)

Begin Time: 18:30

This evening is hosted and sponsored by A1 Telekom who will also provide drinks & snacks.

Very much looking forward to this exciting meetup event!
