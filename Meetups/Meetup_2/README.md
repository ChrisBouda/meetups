## Details

The date for our second Deep Learning Meetup is set: Monday, May 9, again at sektor 5!

UPDATE: We will have two presentations at this meetup:

**Alex Champandard: "Neural Networks for Image Synthesis"**

Alex's talk will dig into image generation with neural networks, in particular algorithms for style transfer. He'll discuss some of the technical aspects as well as experiences using the various algorithms available. Alex is a researcher and developer in Creative AI, working on projects ranging from games, simulation and image synthesis. He co-founded the nucl.ai Conference (held in Vienna) that focuses on Artificial Intelligence in Creative Industries.

**Gregor Mitscha-Baude: "Recurrent Neural Networks"**

Gregor will enlighten us what exactly are "Recurrent Neural Networks" and tell us about his experience with RNNs. Gregor is doing a PhD in math/scientific computing and his talk will cover the following: Motivation, examples and basics of RNNs; introduction to LSTM - the most important building block used in modern RNNs; recent development of attention/memory mechanisms, like the Neural Turing Machine.

Please also let us know if you want to suggest further topics for discussion!

Very much looking forward!
