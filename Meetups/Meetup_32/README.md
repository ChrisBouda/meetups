## Details

Dear Deep Learners,

We are happy to invite you to the first meetup of 2020! It will happen on January 30th, covering self-supervised learning in different domains, and a report from the NeurIPS 2019 conference.

**Talk 1:
Self-Supervised Deep Learning**
by Christoph Bonitz, Njinn Technologies

Deep Learning can leverage giant amounts of data, and compute performance has improved a lot. This means that the cost and logistics of creating datasets for supervised learning are often the bottleneck for model performance. In NLP, this limitation has recently been overcome using self-supervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. This talk introduces self-supervised and semi-supervised learning in general, and gives a brief tour of some interesting and surprising research in vastly different application areas.

Christoph Bonitz holds a master’s degree in Computational Intelligence, has spent his career in various software engineering and architecture roles building data-centric products, and currently works on a workflow automation platform at Njinn Technologies.

**Talk 2:
Report from NeurIPS 2019**
by René Donner, contextflow GmbH
[[Slides](<./slides/VDLM Neurips 2019 recap.pdf>)]

The yearly "Neural Information Processing Systems" conference is one of the largest machine learning conferences. In 2019, it took place in Vancouver, from December 8 to 14, with around 13,000 attendees. René will discuss a small selection of the 1,428 papers presented at the conference.
