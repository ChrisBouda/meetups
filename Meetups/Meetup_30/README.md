## Details

 Dear Deep Learners,

Fake news is a big topic these days and most  likely you have also heard about Deep Fakes. At our next meetup on  October 29th we will have a special talk about Deep Fakes and fake news.  In addition, we will hear about Anomaly Detection with GANs.


**Talk 1:
Fake News. From Shallow to Deep. How to create, detect and fight it.**
by Alexander Schindler, Research Scientist, Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)
[[Slides](./slides/Fake_news_VDLM_2019_10_29.pdf)] 

Deep Fakes impressively demonstrated the potential of deep learning for  media production. This potential also raises concerns and fears that  this technology could be misused to create and disseminate  misinformation. The few well engineered examples available underline  these concerns and light-headed projects such as "Deep Nude" further  incite them. But how do these technologies work? Are there any flaws  that can be used to automatically detect fake media and are Deep Fakes  the only threats or are there more options to fake news? This talk will  provide an overview of approaches to fake news and how to detect those.

Alexander  Schindler is a research scientist at Austrian Institute of Technology  (AIT) and member of the Music Information Retrieval Lab at the TU Wien.  His research fields are audio, audio-visual and multi/cross-modal  analysis of media.


**Talk 2:
Anomaly Detection with GANs**
by Thomas Schlegl, Machine learning Engineer and Data Scientist at contextflow

 The detection and quantification of anomalous patterns in medical images  that correlate with disease status is very important during diagnosis  and enables monitoring of disease progression or treatment response.  This talk presents an anomaly detection technique that is based on  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and its application in medical  image analysis. A GAN learns to generate data that follows the  distribution seen during training. The presented anomaly detection  framework trains a GAN on normal images to create a rich generative  model of healthy local anatomical appearance and allows for quantitative  assessment of new images using the learned generative model.

Thomas  Schlegl is a machine learning engineer and data scientist at  contextflow GmbH - a company building an image search engine for  radiologists. His research interests focus on medical image analysis,  biostatistics, and multimodal learning of deep representations based on  visual and textual clinical data.  

**Latest News and Hot Topics:**

 As usual we will feature latest news and hot topics about Deep Learning.  Moreover, Elisabeth Fink will present the best talks from the O'Reilly  AI conference in San Jose, CA in September.

This meetup is kindly hosted by A1 Telekom.

Looking forward to welcoming you,
Tom, Alex, Jan, Ren√©
