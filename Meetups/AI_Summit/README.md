Dear Deep Learning and AI community,

We have a special surprise for you: Motivated by the steadily growing crowd at our meetups, we have been planning now something bigger. The Vienna Deep Learning Meetup teamed up with Michael Platzer from Mostly AI and together we are organizing a special event on Artificial Intelligence this September in Vienna:

The AI Summit Vienna ( http://mostly.ai/summit )
4th of September, 16:00 @ WU Vienna

For this first AI Summit ever held in Vienna, we managed to put together a great line-up of international researchers and practitioners:

• Sepp Hochreiter, JKU Linz, Inventor of the Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM-RNN)

• Tomáš Mikolov, Facebook, AI Research Scientist, prev. developer of Word2Vec at Google Brain

• Dave Elliott, Google, Global Product Lead, Enterprise Cloud

• Calvin Seward, Zalando, Deep Learning Research Scientist at Zalando Lab

• Ulla Kruhse-Lehtonen, DAIN Studios (Data and Artificial Intelligence consulting & product startup), formerly Director of Analytics at Nokia

Our speakers will present state-of-the-art topics in Deep Learning and AI and give us insights into latest developments in Artificial Intelligence and their application to real-world problems. Detailed information about the event schedule and speaker line-up is available here: http://mostly.ai/summit (http://mostly.ai/summit/)

In the tradition of our meetup series, there will also be ample room for networking and discussion, over a range of snacks, drinks and beers.

Registration for this exceptional event will be handled via Eventbrite only, and will cost 8 Euro. Note: This is still a volunteer-organized, not-for-profit event, and we set the price as low as possible, to make it accessible for everyone. Ticket revenues will solely be used to cover location and catering costs. All our speakers agreed to come for free, and we are very very grateful for their support of our community!
