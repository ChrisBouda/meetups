## Details

Hi Deep Learners,

The 10th Deep Learning Meetup in Vienna is coming up! And we are excited!
Our topic this time is Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars.

Our Speaker is Oleg Leizerov who has recently finished the first term of the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree at Udacity (prepared together with NVIDIA, Uber (Otto) and Mercedes-Benz). He is going to present a summary of the real-world autonomous driving problems and challenges which were approached in the projects:

• lane lines and vehicle detection

• traffic signs classification

• behavior cloning (where the car was trained to drive in the simulator using just images from 3 side cameras)

with some details about the approaches which were used to solve them (incl. Computer Vision and Deep Learning using Convolution Neural Networks with Yann LeCun's architectures, among others) plus a summary of what worked/didn't work.

After the talk we will have time to discuss hot new topics and other challenges the people in this community face. If you want to suggest a topic please do so below this meetup description.

Please note the location Automic Software at Am Europlatz 5 in Meidling, and the earlier begin time: 18:00.

Looking forward!
