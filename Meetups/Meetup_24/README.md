## Details

This time we have a very interesting talk about the application of Deep Learning in medical imaging, a presentation of a new open-source annotation tool for images as well as our usual hot topics & announcements!

**Talk 1:
Deep Learning for Ophthalmology - Diagnosis and Treatment of Eye Disorders**
by Hrvoje Bogunovic (Medical University Vienna)
[[Slides](./slides/HB_DeepLearning_Ophthalmology.pdf)]

Ophthalmology is at the forefront of deep learning applications in medicine due to the ability to image the retina quickly and non-invasively. Deep learning recently enabled a first of its kind FDA approved fully autonomous diagnostic system and the field is attracting deep learning giants like Google, DeepMind and Baidu. I will show how deep learning is used for quantification of imaging biomarkers, automated diagnosis and progression prediction of prominent retinal diseases, the leading causes of blindness today.

**Talk 2:
Computer Vision Annotation Tool**
by Alexander Hirner (moonvision.io)
[[Slides](./slides/Annotation_Best_Practices_dl_vie.pdf)]

In computer vision, as with any task, you’d want to strive for the best data in the shortest amount of time. Over the course of several projects, we built tools to quickly annotate videos and images for object detection and segmentation. We share labelling best-practices and the free version of our tool.

**Interesting Papers & Hot Topics**

If you have hot topics to present or announcements to make please let us know beforehand.

In the break and after the talks there will be time for networking and discussions. We thank T-Mobile for hosting us this time. Our host kindly provides us with pizza and drinks in the break!
